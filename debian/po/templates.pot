"Jitsi Meet is best to be set up with an SSL certificate. If you have no "
"certificate, we can generate a self-signed one. If you have a certificate "
"signed by a recognised CA, you can upload it on the server  and point us to "
"its location. The default filenames will be /etc/ssl/--domain.name--.key  "
"for the key and /etc/ssl/--domain.name--.crt for the certificate."
