Jitsi Meet - Secure, Simple and Scalable Video Conferences 
====
Jitsi Meet is an OpenSource (MIT) WebRTC JavaScript application that uses [Jitsi Videobridge](https://jitsi.org/videobridge) to provide high quality, scalable video conferences. You can see [Jitsi Meet in action](http://youtu.be/7vFUVClsNh0) here at the 482 session of the VoIP Users Conference.

You can also try it out yourself at https://meet.jit.si .

Jitsi Meet allows for very efficient collaboration. It allows users to stream their desktop or only some windows. It also shared document editing with Etherpad and remote presentations with Prezi. 

## Install

Installing Jitsi Meet is quite a simple experience even though it requires it requires installing a few other components first, such as Jitsi Videobridge, a web server such as Nginx and an XMPP one like Prosody.
